    # Definition of the DeviceInterface

    is_simulator:
        description: Ask if the connected class is a simulator instead of the real device Controller class.
        returns: bool | True if the far end is a simulator instead of the real hardware

    is_connected:

    connect:
        description: Connect the Hexapod hardware controller

    reconnect:
        description: Reconnect the Hexapod hardware controller.
            
            This command will force a disconnect and then try to re-connect to the controller.

    disconnect:
        description: Disconnect from the TCU controller.
            
            This command will be send to the TCU Control Server which will then
            disconnect from the hardware controller.
            
            This command does not affect the ZeroMQ connection of the Proxy to the
