"""
This module provides a dummy implementation for classes of the commanding chain.

Start the control server with:
```shell
py -m egse.dummy start-cs
```
and stop the server with:
```shell
py -m egse.dummy stop-cs
```
Commands that can be used with the proxy:

  * info – returns an info message from the dummy device, e.g. "Dummy Device <__version__>"
  * get_value – returns a random float between 0.0 and 1.0
  * division – returns the result of the division between arguments 'a' and 'b'.
    This can be used also to induce a ZeroDivisionError that should return a Failure
    object.

The device simulator can be started with:
```
py -m egse.dummy start-dev
```
